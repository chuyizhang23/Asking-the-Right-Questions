# Preface

The author first expresses his concern about how irrational the public discussions currently are while emphasizing that **being selective in argument** is essential to our daily life. The author then declares that the goal of this book is to benefit society by helping to **develop and cultivate more critical thinkers** who can sort and select optimal responses.

This book is intended for **general audiences**, so it is made readable and short. Many details that the author thinks are more appropriate to be reserved for a more specialized group of readers in a book dedicated to a more weighty treatment of critical thinking are omitted.

> Critical thinking is not primarily an effort to demonstrate what is faulty about the thinking of others. Instead, it is a process for **improving the beliefs and decisions** each of us must make.

Any reasoning, good or bad, provides row material for critical thinking. Critical thinking is a **process of reaction**, and the task is to decide whether to accept the argument and make it our own.
